*Automating Checkout Flow in nopCommerce Using Selenium, C#, and SpecFlow*

Overview
This project demonstrates how to automate the checkout process on the nopCommerce e-commerce platform using Selenium WebDriver, C#, and SpecFlow. nopCommerce is an open-source e-commerce solution based on ASP.NET Core, and automating its checkout flow allows for efficient testing and validation of the purchasing process.

Features
Automated Checkout Flow: The project automates the entire checkout process, including selecting products, adding them to the cart, entering shipping and billing information, and completing the order.

Data-Driven Approach: The automation script utilizes a data-driven approach, allowing for multiple test scenarios with different input data. This enhances test coverage and ensures robustness.

Selenium WebDriver: Selenium WebDriver is used for browser automation, enabling interaction with web elements and simulating user actions such as clicking buttons and entering text.

C# and SpecFlow: The automation script is implemented in C# and utilizes SpecFlow, a behavior-driven development (BDD) framework for .NET, to write and execute acceptance tests using natural language specifications.
